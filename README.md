Notes on the holiday hack challenge.

# Dependencies:
- Nodejs

# Basic setup you need
- Burp or ZAP Proxy; I use Burp. Any proxy which lets you manipulate WebSockets will do.
- Chromium browser configured to use your proxy as listed in the previous point.
- The Proxy SSL certificate installed in Chromium.


- Why Chromium? Because the Javascript debugger actually works and you'll need to debug Javascript code.

# Gates
Things I've figured out:
- There's a DNA
- It can be manipulated by playing with WebSockets
- You can send a forged DNA, but still need to update the response from the server for the missingno. image to appear.

The Main.js file contains this snippet:

![Data lengths](docs/main001.png?raw=true "Data lengths")

From there you can infer the amount of characters used to encode the DNA. Note the interface limits the "torso" and "legs" options to 9 values: 0 to 8.
However the size specified in the JS says 8 letters. But each number is encoded in base 4:

![Number mapping](docs/main002.png?raw=true "Data mapping")

The interface lets you pick a number between 0 and 8, being these:
- 0: AT AT
- 1: AT TA
- 2: AT GC
- 3: AT CG
- 4: TA AT
- 5: TA TA
- 6: TA GC
- 7: TA CG
- 8: GC AT

All these are using 4 characters, but we've seen above we can use up to 8; which means that GC AT AT AT would still be a valid "torso".



The DNA needs to contain the numbers mapped only. So AT, TA, CG, GC. There's a DNA listed [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/MLACourse/Modules/BLAST/q_jurassicparkDNA.html) which won't work because it contains non-accepted symbols, like TT.

The decoding function reads as follows:
`decodeDNASequence: e => b.unpack((e.match(/..?/g) || []).map(e => h[e]).join(""), 4),`


Deobfuscated would be (not tested):

`decodeDNASequence: (e) => {

  const parts = (e.match(/..?/g) || []); // Maps becomes an array like [ ['AT'], ['AT'], ['TA'] ... ], 60 pairs of characters.
  const numbers = parts.map((pair) => { return h[pair]; }); // H is the list of mappings, see above. Now numbers became a list like [[0], [0], [1], ... ]
  const stringOfNumbers = numbers.join(""); // Glue them all together
  return b.unpack(stringOfNumbers, 4);  //
}
`


See [legs](assets/images/avatars/legs_full_boards.png?raw=true) and [torso](assets/images/avatars/torso_full_boards.png?raw=true) images. Both images include 3 additional transparent sections. It seems the options:

legs: 9, 10 11
torso: 9, 10, 11

Appear in the image, but are not available in the interface. The allowed values in the interface are 0 to 8.


Possible options would be:
