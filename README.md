Notes on the holiday hack challenge.

Things I've figured out:
- There's a DNA
- It can be manipulated by playing with WebSockets
- You can send a forged DNA, but still need to update the response from the server for the missingno. image to appear.


The Main.js file contains this snippet:

![Data lengths](docs/main001.png?raw=true "Data lengths")

From there you can infer the amount of characters used to encode the DNA. Note the interface limits the "torso" and "legs" options to 9 values: 0 to 8.
However the size specified in the JS says 8 letters. But each number is encoded in base 4:

![Number mapping](docs/main002.png?raw=true "Data mapping")

The interface lets you pick a number between 0 and 8, being these:
- 0: AT AT
- 1: AT TA
- 2: AT GC
- 3: AT CG
- 4: TA AT
- 5: TA TA
- 6: TA GC
- 7: TA CG
- 8: GC AT

All these are using 4 characters, but we've seen above we can use up to 8; which means that GC AT AT AT would still be a valid "torso".

Need to bring my GF to a place, I'll continue this later!
